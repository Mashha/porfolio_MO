                <h1>Sunny side landing page</h1>
                <p>A stunning colorful landing page, build with mostly HTML and CSS.</p>

                <p>I got the idea for the project from frontend mentor. They have projects for free and you get 
                    a few photos (computer and mobile version). Paid version includes a figma file, which i do not have. 
                </p>
                <p>It was definitely challenging to make it look as similar as possible with just a few images, but i enjoyed the poscess to the last detail.</p>
                <p>Project is made with flexbox and grid. The is a little bit of JavaScript</p>
