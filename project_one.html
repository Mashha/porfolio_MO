              A website of a coffee and dessert shop; you can check what they
              offer in the menu, read about the coffee shop and find all the
              contact information.

            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>
              The first thing I did was, I created the structure of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I brainstormed for the ideas, searched for images, icons and
              fonts. And I made the design in figma.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made the color pallette and logo in figma. The png images in the
              menu are from canva.
            </p>
            <p>I started implementing design, and added more JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
              And for the finishing touches I made it responsive and applied
              some final design changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is made with JavaScript. There is only one element in
              HTML, where all the JavaScript created elements go to. The whole
              point of this project was to basically learn how to implement and
              use webpack. And although it seemed a bit overwhelming at first, I
              started to understand it quickly. Navigation links open in the
              same tab and menu in home page allows you to download the pdf file
              with the menu.
