            <h1>Shopping cart</h1>
            <p>
              Online store shop for indoor plants. You can browse through shop, sort by size of the plant. 
              Add plants to cart and also sign in/out to/from the page.

            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>This project was made in react.</p>
            <p>
              I've done the design in figma and experimented with 12 column grid to get the hero section properly divided.
            </p>
            <p>
              There a few horizontal scroll options. I've added currency - so it gets recognized by where you live. 
              Total amount changes in the cart based by the amount of plants. And you can change quantity in the cart or remove the item.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as you add plants to cart they are stored in local storage. I also implemented the auth0 login.
              And would like to add storage to a specific user.
            </p>
            <p>This website is also responsive.</p>
