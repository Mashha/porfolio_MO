              I made this page, to add, edit and remove books, check if the
              books have been read or not. As an additional feature you can add
              an image, if you don't, the mock cover will be chosen.

            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>This project was mostly made in JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
              The design is definitely simple for now, but this is one of the
              first projects I would like to improve a lot as soon as I get some
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found the font that really suits the book theme. And added light
              and dark option for the background.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to be able to store books, add an API to find books
              easier, apply some additional features, add a login and improve
              the design.
            </p>
            <p>This website is also responsive.</p>
