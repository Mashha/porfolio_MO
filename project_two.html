              With this calculator you can do all the basic operations: add,
              subtract, divide, multiply and i added the percentage and decimal
              option as well. If you want to clear the screen you can choose to
              clear the whole screen or one by one.

            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>
              Calculator project was the last project when I finished learning
              fundamentals of JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was really fun for me. I got to learn how to use the
              debugger and it is a life saver to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design part was also very enjoyable. I first made a simple
              design with a linear gradient.
            </p>

            <p>
              And for the second design I wanted to create something a bit
              different, I made an svg in figma, also with gradient and then
              implemented it into the top part of the calculator.
            </p>
            <p>I also made sure it's responsive.</p>
