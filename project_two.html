                <h1>Calculator project</h1>
                <p>With this calculator you can do all the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, multiply and i added the percentage and decimal option as well. If you want to clear the screen you can choose to clear the whole screen or one by one.</p>

                <p>Calculator project was the last project when i finished learning fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>
                <p>This project was really fun for me. I got to learn how to use the debugger and it is a life saver to this day.</p>
                <p>The design part was also very enjoyable. I first made a simple design with linear gradient.</p>
                <img src="./images/calculator-first-design.png" alt="">
                <p>And for the second design i wanted to create something a bit different, i made an svg in figma, also with gradient and then implemented it into the top part of the calculator.</p>
                <p>I also made sure it's responsive.</p>
