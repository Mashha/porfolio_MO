            <h1>Tic tac toe</h1>
            <p>Tic tac toe is a game where you can play a round against the computer.</p>

            <p>This game was fun to build, I was introduced to module pattern and factory functions, so i took a bit different approach.
                The goal was not to have any global variables.
            </p>
            <p>I made my own svgs in figma and added them to css.</p>
            <p>I was trying to think outside of the box and make it a bit differently, since everyone uses standard X's and O's, i used owls.
                You can choose one owls out of 4.
            </p>
            <p>My next step is to take this game a bit further and implement AI, to make the game more fun.</p>
            <p>The whole game is responsive.</p>
