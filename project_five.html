            <p>
              This game was fun to build, I was introduced to module pattern and
              factory functions, so i took a bit different approach. The goal
              was not to have any global variables.
            </p>
            <p>I made my own svgs in figma and added them to css.</p>
            <p>
              I was trying to think outside of the box and make it a bit
              differently, since everyone uses standard X's and O's, i used
              owls. You can choose one out of 4 owls.
            </p>
            <p>
              My next step is to take this game a bit further and implement AI,
              to make the game more fun.
            </p>
            <p>The whole game is responsive.</p>
