            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project definitely took the most time. It has a lot of details and important parts you cannot overlook. 
              The basis of this project were CRUD operations - to be able to create, read, update and delete each project and each task.
              MVC - to separate view from logic. I used webpack and added date-fns library to easier filter tasks for the coming week.
            </p>
            <p>I made the simple and clean design in figma along with the logo.</p>
            <p>
              This project is the first one that has the local storage, so you can leave tasks on and they will stay there. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a lot more ideas for this project, like adding an option to sign in, connecting calendar on the computer/phone and maybe even a quote of the day to make it nicer. 
            </p>
            <p>The project is responsive</p>
